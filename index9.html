		<p> Vipassana Meditation has been practiced for over 2500 years. Simply, it is a method of self observation that focuses on the deep connection between the body, mind and breath. Mnay practitioners find that frequent practice results in increased awareness, focus, self-control and peace. 
		</p>

		<p> I am new to practicing Vipassana. In the past few months I have attended guided community meditation classes at Charm City Yoga as well as a daily guided practice with the HeadSpace App. In a talk by Tata Brach she descibed her meditative practive as buiding "a heart that is ready for anything." This resonated with me. I find that my practice has made it easier to  handle stress and hardship, connect with my body and my artwork.
		</p>

		<p> My projects aims to teach the most basic principles of meditation. The audience is guided through basic breathing and ways of dealing with their thoughts and sensations. The goal of this practice is to become very aware of oneself and surroundings.
