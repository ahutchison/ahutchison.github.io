	  		<p>For my project I wanted to track down a number of people who I need to thank. </p>

			<p>The first person was detective Anthony Sierra of the Baltimore Police Department. He was off duty when I was attacked on Federal Hill a year ago, but apprehended the three men he saw fleeing the scene of the crime. Within fifteen-or-so minutes of the attack he had the whole neighborhood filled with police cars, patrolling helicopters, my belongings were returned and the men were lined up along the highway for identification. </p>


			<p> I called him to thank him for his work and make it clear that without him the investigation and legal process would have looked much different, not to mention how compassionate he was during questioning. </p>

			<p>Detective Sierra gave me the phone number of the two witnesses, Holly and Jason, so I could get in contact and properly thank them as well. </p>

			<p>I owed Jason the biggest thank you. He had been sitting with his wife in Federal Hill and ran to help when he heard me screaming. He stopped the men beating my friend and scared them off. Later he identified them. </p>

			<p>I called both Jason and Holly last Wednesday and left messages explaining who I was and that I really wanted the opportunity to say a real thank you. I was nervous that they wouldn’t want to rehash the memory, or would be put off in some way by my request. Jason left me a message later that day saying how happy they were to hear from me, that I was doing well and that I was more than welcome to come over. </p>

			<p>On Sunday I visited them at their home in Federal Hill. I was prepared for an awkward exchange because we are essentially strangers, but with one awful thing in common. I was so humbled by the way they welcomed me into their home in the middle of dinner with their young children. We had a drink and talked about what had happened. I filled them in on the details of how the trial had turned out. At some point we stopped talking about the crime and started talking about art, architecture, the things we love about Baltimore…</p>

			<p>I gave them with an aloe plant in a pot I painted. I wrote about the experience and my memories of Jason rescuing us and cut the pieces of paper into a lotus. While thanking them I shared one of my clearest memories from the attack. After the men had run away and we were sitting on someone’s stoop waiting for the police, and all the neighbors came out to make sure we were taken care of.</p> 


			<blockquote>I remember thinking that even if those men represented the absolute worst parts of humanity, there was a community of so many more gathering around us to make sure it was made right.</blockquote>

			<p>This was such a wonderful prompt. It was really important for me to own my gratitude and recognize someone for it. The feeling I am coming away with is one of whole-ness, and that there is an incredible capability of human beings to do unexpected, uncalled-for, brave and compassionate things. </p>
