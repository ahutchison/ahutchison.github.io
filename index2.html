 			<p>For my final project I wanted to explore my favorite film, Amelie. (2001, Jean-Pierre Jeunet) For me, the most striking thing about this movie has always been the way colors have been filtered and saturated. Red and green are most predominantly used to paint a nostalgic picture of Paris in 1997. </p>

			<p>I re-watched the film and took screen shots every few minutes. From the roughly 150 images I took, I used the eye-dropper tool to isolate the different shades of red that appear in props, clothing and settings.</p>

			<p>I thought it would be interesting to analyze and represent a quality that would normally simply be appreciated as a clever artistic choice. I am curious about the meeting of something analytical (an infographic charting the specific uses of color within the range of a single hue) and something artistic. (Juenetâ€™s use of the color to create a romantic mood in his film).</p>

			<p>In the film, red objects serve to draw attention to Amelie and her unusual character. Important red props and costumes punctuate almost every scene. I wanted my project to have the same resonance in real space that the red objects do in the film. For this reason I chose to represent my findings in a poster. </p>
