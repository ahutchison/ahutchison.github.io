 			<h2> Go with the Flow - No Strings Attached </h2>
 			<p> For my project I chose to create a brand that opposed the DivaCup; a menstrual cup marketed as an alternative to disposable pads and tampons. I think they have a wonderful product but do a terrible job marketing it to the average woman. 
 			</p>

 			<p> Because menstrual cups are reusable they have a significantly smaller environmental impact as compared to pads and tampons. They are a one time investment, completely sanitary and more reliable (mess-wise) than the alternative. The feminine hygene industry creates wasteful products that foster a culture of embarassment around the functions of women's bodies. It's about hiding. My product will be different. 
 			</p>

 			<p>
 			My goal in marketing Go With the Flow and No Strings Attached to to make a visible product that becomes as mainstream as pads and tampons.
