 		<h1> Eustace Tilley and Refreshing The New Yorker </h1>
 		<p> 
Simon Grenier&apos;s &quot;Brooklyn&apos;s Eutace&quot; is a timely and amusing interpretation of The New Yorker&apos;s steadfast mascot. In 1925 Rea Irvin drew the character, which was based on an illustration of a French Aristocrat, looking through his monocle at a butterfly. Thanks to the  &apos;Your Eustace&apos; cover design competition, in the 21st century he is reimagined with the same attitude. Grenier&apos;s illustration takes the dandy and translates him into a caricature of Manhattan hipster; beard, bicycle tattoo and ego included. But &quot;Brooklyn&apos;s Eustace&quot; doesn&apos;t stop at the punch line. It articulates (even if topically) what it means to be a Manhattanite. After all, isn&apos;t that the point of the magazine? </p>


<p>
For the past eighty-eight years The New Yorker has set out to chronicle the social and artistic climate of perhaps the most &apos;cultured&apos; city on earth. In its commentary of pop culture, social news, and current events, the magazine has become an emblem of everything a good New Yorker should be; liberal, wealthy, well-educated and sophisticated. It has established this reputation with the help of a few crucial aesthetic choices that characterize the magazine. The most important being the typeface, the layouts, and of course, the character Eustace Tilley, who has appeared annually on the cover since the creation of the magazine. </p>

<p>
The New Yorker&apos;s current creative director, Wyatt Mitchell recently announced that the magazine would be &apos;refreshing&apos; their design. In a video talking about the process he discussed the way they have clarified the classic graphics; these &quot;visual conventions that would endure throughout the publication&apos;s history.&quot; This specifically refers to the Irvin font, full bleed cover illustrations and layouts. Interestingly, the video started and ended with an image of Eustace, but there was no mention of &apos;refreshing&apos; the most classic element of the magazine; the mascot himself. </p>

<p>
In his piece, In Praise of Slow Design, Michael Beirut says, &quot;Publication design is a field addicted to ceaseless reinvention.&quot; He also suggests that The New Yorker&apos;s decision not to drastically modernize itself is brave and strategic. Even the changes that are coming about now are &quot;patient, cautious, deliberate evolution of a nearly unchanging editorial format.&quot; Perhaps the magazine understands the comfort of finding something unchanged in such a chaotic and anxious society? </p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Regardless of the motive, the &apos;slow design&apos; mentality of The New Yorker lends itself to the idea of an American classic. The act of &apos;refreshing&apos; something timeless walks a fine line. Every move The New Yorker makes needs to be dictated by its history while finding a way to be relevant in the year 2013. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
But still, somehow the most untouchable element of the magazine is Eustace. Because of his style of dress he is the most old fashioned aspect remaining. Louis Menard ask the question &quot;Are readers meant to identify with the cover or laugh at it?&quot; Even eighty-eight years ago he idea of the Eustace was not meant to be entirely serious. He is a romantic albeit slightly snobbish anachronism. </p>

<p>
In 2007 The New Yorker called for entries for it&apos;s &quot;Your Eustace&apos; competition. For the first time real New Yorkers had the chance to take some artistic license with the mascot and project their own values and opinions onto him. Eustace has since been &apos;refreshed&apos; with a cleaner design, turned into a woman, a dog, and the same butterfly he gazed at. He has been drawn as the Three Stooges, Mr. Burns, a TSA agent and Einstein. </p>

<p>
In the 2013 competition, five of the twelve finalists made specific references to  social media in their reinterpretations of Eustace. There was &quot;Eustace-gram&quot;, &quot;Eustace in Gangham Style&quot;, &quot;Eustace Emoji&quot;, &quot;Coded Age&quot; and &quot;Eustace_Texting_Tilley.&quot; Grenier, the winner of this year&apos;s competition also made reference to symbols of pop culture while drawing a clever parallel between this idea of the hipster and the dandy. If anything is aligned with The New Yorker&apos;s goal to be both modern and classic it is the caricature of Brooklyn hipster. </p>

<p>
The act of giving the audience permission to reinterpret a character gives them the opportunity to express opinions of the icon or themes of the time. In the past competition it was themes of technology and nostalgia for the past. Issues of the economic crisis, patriarchy and homeland security are just a few of the themes presented in the six years the competition has run. </p>

<p>
Not only is it a chance to make Eustace &quot;timely&apos;, the competition also works to solidify his icon status. He is so famous that we can interpret him however we choose, but at the end of the day he always returns to his top hat, gazing at the butterfly. The reference is just that, a play on something that is set in stone. </p>

<p>
What could more pleasing than seeing that juxtaposition of who we were and who we are on the same page? And better yet, drawn beautifully on the cover of our magazine? It validates us as belonging to our history and driving in our culture forward. After all, isn&apos;t that the romantic notion of what it means to be a New Yorker that we wish to perpetuate? </p>
